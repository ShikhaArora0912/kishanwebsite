              Students are introduced to a more structured approach to choreography, using dance devices, elements, and structures.
              <br><br>
              Level 2 Dance builds on this to develop choreographic skills and movement exploration and to develop ideas and opinions, with the addition of guest practitioners and live performances.

              In Level 3 the course is based on a theme which influences the topic choices students make to complete their chosen Achievement Standards.
              <br><br>
              The Ministry of Education also funds a small number of hours for the tuition of instrumental music. This involves specialist teachers coming to the school to give small group tuition to selected students. The students are timetabled to have their lesson during school hours. 
              Students are able to apply to learn an instrument each year and once they have reached a certain standard are encouraged to join a co-curricular group. This is a great opportunity to learn an instrument.
